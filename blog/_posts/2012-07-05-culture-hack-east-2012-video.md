I recently hacked at [Culture Hack East](http://www.creativefront.org/news-and-events/news/photos-from-culture-hack-east-2012), and the folks at [Project Trident](http://projecttrident.com) were there making a short [video of the day](http://vimeo.com/45129897). I think this sums up a lot of what happens at a cultural hack day, so I'll leave it at that, other than to say "I've finished my first hack... I'm going to make another" sums up a lot!
