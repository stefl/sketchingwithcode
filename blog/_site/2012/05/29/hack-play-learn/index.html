<p>Build, Measure, Learn. It&#8217;s the new mantra adopted by many a tech startup thanks to Eric Ries&#8217;s influential <a href='http://theleanstartup.com'>The Lean Startup</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent a good deal of time over the last few years involved in (more than one) startup. In many ways I&#8217;m very grateful for this simple, shorthand phrase to describe the process of taking an idea, seeing if it works, iterating and building a product in an agile way. It&#8217;s a useful encapsulation of a lot of the processes you go through in a (in my case media/web/software) startup, where code is relatively easy to create, but it&#8217;s hard to know what the right code to write might be.</p>

<p>The essential process is that given some kind of user problem, you propose a hypothesis or a number of hypotheses around what might be a solution. Then you build as minimal an intervention as possible to test it - it might be a little web app, or making a video to express the idea, or a landing page to see if people might like a product even though it doesn&#8217;t exist. Then you measure the success of the intervention, and from that measurement you learn about what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t. Then you iterate - build, measure, learn, and repeat.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a strong idea, and I know a fair few companies who are using this to build digital products - in fact it&#8217;s almost becoming a dogmatic thing. &#8220;What are our learnings?&#8221;, despite the wince-inducing word-crime, is becoming something of a catch-phrase.</p>

<p>However, looking at the way that I do things, I think that &#8220;Build, measure, learn&#8221; doesn&#8217;t fully encompass what&#8217;s going on when I&#8217;m building something.</p>

<p>If the purpose of a startup is to &#8220;learn&#8221;, then of course you can go for the &#8220;set a hypothesis, test it&#8221; approach, but at the very beginning of a project, way before you have users, I don&#8217;t see how you can measure anything with any kind of significance.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#8217;re making a &#8220;Minimum Viable Product&#8221; (MVP), I&#8217;m seeing that a lot of companies, not least ones I&#8217;ve been involved with, spend several months getting to that crucial &#8220;put it in front of the users&#8221; point. And that leaves plenty of room for startup stories that have a chapter beginning with &#8220;it turns out we&#8217;d spent all that time building the wrong thing&#8221;.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s a case of those companies doing it wrong? In the case of the project I&#8217;m working on this Summer with a sports brand, the impulse is to hold back on &#8220;just get out there&#8221; until the app we are building has a decent feature-set that covers a fair amount of what we think users will want it to do. There&#8217;s a fear that we could damage the project by getting reactions like &#8220;this is rubbish&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s broken&#8221;.</p>

<p>The crucial part here is &#8220;what we think users will want&#8221; - and herein lies the danger. We&#8217;ve run events to talk about our ideas with our target users, taken a sketchy version of our iphone app down to the local skate park (it&#8217;s a BMX app!) and so on. But we&#8217;re talking handfuls of users - not the several hundred you&#8217;d need to get any kind of statistically relevant results.</p>

<p>It seems to me that much of the lean startup process is based on the idea of applying scientific principles to startups. But I would argue that anyone with a science background would point out that there is far, far too much noise at the beginning of a project to be able to conduct a proper study and gather anything near a &#8220;scientific&#8221; conclusion.</p>

<p>On talking through that problem I realised that I have a phase that I use that could be usefully applied before you get to that point - &#8220;Hack, play, learn&#8221;.</p>

<p>I like to think of the early days on a project as a sequence of hack days. The idea is not that you will not be able to do anything &#8220;scientific&#8221; in this phase, but rather that a period of play and experimentation occurs before you can get to the &#8220;build, measure, learn&#8221; phase.</p>

<p>Children learn through play, and I&#8217;d argue that so can adults (in the right conditions). I often think about what I&#8217;m doing when I&#8217;m hacking on a little idea as play. I&#8217;ll look at a problem, have some conversations, and often be joking around about what we should do to solve the problem. I&#8217;ve been often surprised that something that starts out with an element of humour tends to lead to very interesting results.</p>

<p>In hack day parlance that&#8217;s a &#8220;comedy hack&#8221;, and at <a href='http://rewiredstate.org'>Rewired State</a> hack day events you often see that the hacks using a bit of technology with a core idea of something humourous are often the best.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s this playfulness I try to channel at the very early stages of a project. No, I&#8217;m not going to write any tests, or follow Test Driven Development, because what I&#8217;m doing is sketching out ideas very quickly (hence &#8220;Sketching with Code&#8221;), playing with stuff on a screen, and getting something that partially works in front of the other folks on the team to play with, maybe run it past a few &#8220;users&#8221;, but in the main it&#8217;s just to see what the solution might look like.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found that I iterate rapidly around hacking up an idea, playing around with it until I&#8217;ve got something to show, and then taking what I&#8217;ve learnt and applying it to the next iteration. And these iterations are often measured in hours, not days.</p>

<p>The result is a joyful process with rapid results, a team that feels enthused and an accelerated project. But also, I think it means you get to learn a lot right at the beginning that can save a lot of time and money down the line because you&#8217;re building and failing on things that just aren&#8217;t right much more rapidly than if you&#8217;re trying to get something acceptable in front of users and measure their responses.</p>

<p>The &#8220;hack, play, learn&#8221; phase is often short-lived, and I use it to evaluate project direction. Then, once you&#8217;ve settled on what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing in the next phase (with a long user journey on post-it-notes on the wall, perhaps), it&#8217;s time to segue over to &#8220;build, measure, learn&#8221;, throw away that hacky code and build it right.</p>

<p>And &#8220;building it right&#8221;, might include other moments where you need to sketch and evaluate the direction for a new feature or product, in which case jumping back into playful mode is, for me, a good way of achieving it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be interested to see if other people follow this kind of approach, and hear about anyone who&#8217;s learnt lessons about the upside and downside to playful approaches to making things.</p>
