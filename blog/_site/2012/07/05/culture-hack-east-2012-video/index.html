<p>I recently hacked at <a href='http://www.creativefront.org/news-and-events/news/photos-from-culture-hack-east-2012'>Culture Hack East</a>, and the folks at <a href='http://projecttrident.com'>Project Trident</a> were there making a short <a href='http://vimeo.com/45129897'>video of the day</a>. I think this sums up a lot of what happens at a cultural hack day, so I&#8217;ll leave it at that, other than to say &#8221;I&#8217;ve finished my first hack&#8230; I&#8217;m going to make another&#8221; sums up a lot!</p>
