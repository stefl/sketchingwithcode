<h2 id='hacking_an_island'>Hacking an island?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s not often you get an opportunity to do that, so I&#8217;m pretty excited about going to the Scottish island of <a href='http://isleofeigg.org'>Eigg</a> and being one of the first <a href='www.welcometosync.com/geeks/'>geeks in residence</a> on Sync&#8217;s new cultural/technology project.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a collection of initial thoughts about what I might do with my time, a bit about my process, and what I hope will come out of my time at (the as-yet purely virtual) <a href='http://eiggbox.com'>Eigg Box</a>.</p>

<h2 id='why_am_i_doing_this'>Why am I doing this?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve just come out of working very hard for three years on <a href='http://aframe.com'>a web video startup</a> (I didn&#8217;t design the sales site btw). For the uninitiated, have a read of the <a href='http://twitter.com/search?q=startuplife'>#startuplife</a> hashtag on twitter. Long hours, too much coffee, lots of ups and downs, but a singular focus on doing one thing really well and getting a successful business off the ground. We did just that, raised a good amount of investment, and it was time for me to change modes.</p>

<p>My new thing is &#8220;playfully hacking on things that matter&#8221;, and I&#8217;m spending my time throwing the net wide, doing a variety of interesting projects with a variety of interesting people. Here&#8217;s a bit about what that means&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;Playful&#8221;, as in not really worrying too much about the end results of making something being something that could turn into a business, or having some idea of an immediate return on investment. I like to approach things with a bit of humour, lightness and just the beginnings of an idea on what could happen, then let conversations and play determine the result.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hacking&#8221;, as in the positive use of the word, not doing illegal things, has been getting a bit of attention recently as a way of rapidly experimenting with solutions to problems, or to learn about something in a &#8220;take it apart and put it back together again&#8221; way.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent the last few years getting good at making digital things really quickly. You&#8217;ll often find me at &#8220;hack days&#8221;, where people get together to make interesting little experiments over a short period of time, often around 36 hours. I&#8217;m researching this stuff at <a href='http://sketchingwithcode.com'>Sketching with Code</a> and you can see <a href='http://stef.io/hacks'>some of the things I&#8217;ve hacked together in the past</a>.</p>

<p>And &#8220;things that matter&#8221;, as in projects that have some kind of output other than just &#8220;make lots of money&#8221;, or &#8220;solve a first world problem for people with iPhones&#8221;. I gave a talk recently at the inagural <a href='http://findbetterproblems.com'>Find Better Problems</a> event, and it seems that a fair few people are getting a little tired of people working in technology focussing all their efforts on getting people to see more ads, buy virtual products for an online game or work out a way to compete with Tim Berners Lee&#8217;s &#8220;Anything you can do I can do meta&#8221;.</p>

<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot that cultural organisations can learn from creative technologists who work in this way, and vice versa, so I&#8217;m bringing this &#8220;playfully hacking on things that matter&#8221; idea to Eigg, and I&#8217;m keeping my mind open to what might happen as a result.</p>

<p>Today, I start my journey from London, and I&#8217;ll be spending the weekend meeting Lucy and friends, talking to <a href='http://triggerstuff.co.uk'>Suzy</a> about some of the ideas that are floating around, coming up with others, and we&#8217;ll probably have a few hacks to show by the time I come back on Tuesday.</p>
