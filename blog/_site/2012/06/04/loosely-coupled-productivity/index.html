  <h1>Loosely-coupled productivity</h1>
</header>
<p>A short conversation on Twitter made me realise something. In early projects I tend towards working in a very loosely-coupled way in order to maximise everyone&#8217;s productivity. I wonder if there&#8217;s something to explore here when we think about how hack projects, rapid collaborations and hackdays work best.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thread:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently working on a project that&#8217;s a web-app, an API and a (currently iOS only) mobile app. There are lots of moving parts because it&#8217;s a tool for people to capture, upload, transcode and share short sports videos from their phone.</p>

<p>Interestingly, because we&#8217;ve got such a strong team of people we&#8217;ve each got trust in the others&#8217; abilities to do good work, so my approach for making sure we&#8217;re productive is to make sure there&#8217;s a &#8220;loosely-coupled&#8221; approach not just to the software but to wherever we each overlap.</p>

<p>So my colleague who&#8217;s working on the mobile app doesn&#8217;t have to know how any of the rest of the system works internally - &#8220;Just get the video online and send the app the URL&#8221; was the starting point, and it was a good way to make sure that as we hacked the prototype together that we didn&#8217;t block eachother.</p>

<p>At hackdays I&#8217;ve experienced similar issues. There&#8217;s a tendency for the day to be about co-creating for teams of several people. Essentially, if you&#8217;re working with, say, six people, you&#8217;d need to go through the &#8220;form, storm, norm, perform&#8221; cycle in just a handful of hours in order to get something working on a screen - which is a hard task if you&#8217;ve not worked together before.</p>

<p>For some projects that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s required - perhaps it&#8217;s a hard problem, or there are lots of moving parts that need attention from multiple people, but in my own behaviour I&#8217;ve noticed that because I&#8217;ve got a number of things that I&#8217;ve already made, it&#8217;s often more efficient for me to sit by myself (after working out what to do, but that&#8217;s a separate post) and blast something out.</p>

<p><a href='http://chircle.com'>Chircle</a> is an example of this. I arrived at <a href='http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/codeafrica/article3358455.ece'>CodeAfrica</a>, organised by the Times, and the event was very much geared around the idea of forming teams of several people and everyone working on an idea together. I wasn&#8217;t in a &#8220;chatty&#8221; mood - I wanted to make a working app, with an interesting interface, branding, basically the full stack, in a day. I realised that in order to do that much, there wasn&#8217;t much room for me to share code and design tasks.</p>

<p>Because hackdays are seen as very collaborative things, it&#8217;s hard to push back sometimes against the &#8220;let&#8217;s brainstorm&#8221; mode that many people think is a good way to kick things off. Personally, I find one interesting conversation with someone who has a problem is the best way to get things going. &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s interesting, have you ever thought of &#8230;?&#8221; or &#8220;Ha! You know what we should do that would be really funny&#8230;?&#8221; seem to be the things that get me started on a hack.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not to say that I didn&#8217;t have help. I had conversations. I asked opinions. I sat with some other folk and chatted about stuff, and made sure I moved around a lot.</p>

<p>A third example - <a href='http://mixilist.com'>Mixilist</a> - this was a hack I did with <a href='http://twitter.com/Yummity'>Emily</a> at a <a href='http://rewiredstate.org.uk'>Rewired State</a> event. We also had a loosely-coupled approach. I was &#8220;building&#8221; it, but we were having conversations together, making decisions, thinking about what it should be and why, and Emily was able to produce a brand, graphics and so on, and we had a very light way of working together - she passed me a USB stick or sent an email occasionally!</p>

<p>So for hackdays and culture-hacks, I&#8217;m interested in these things - for many of us is it about the collaboration, the large team approach to working on a problem? Do we get &#8220;better&#8221; or &#8220;more polished&#8221; results on hack projects if we keep our teams small (like Mixilist), solo (like Chircle) and/or is there something to be said for having loosely-coupled teams (like my current day-project)?</p>

<p>Perhaps the term &#8220;loosely-coupled productivity&#8221; is over-egging a simple idea, but it might be something I bear in mind next time I&#8217;m throwing together a quick hack, or doing a collaboration to explore an idea.</p>
