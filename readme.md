Sketching with Code
===================

I'm researching the application of the "hack", "geek in residence" and other ideas that cultural organisations are playing with in the drift towards digital culture. 

What works, what doesn't, what's new, what's old, where are we going next.

So I'm building this little app to hold everything along the way. I've not seen many people using Padrino + Jekyll in an app (I expect there to be other more database/api-involved moving parts at some point), so I'm putting the code online here.
